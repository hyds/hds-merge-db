=head1 SYNOPSIS

This script aims to merge two large Hydstra(TM) systems into one system.

It assumes that when merging two or more Hydstra systems, you will want to keep one of the systems intact. This is called the "base system". 

If there are clashes in the keys and values of records between the base system and another source system, the base system will not be modified.

Therefore the other source systems will need to be modified in some way to retain the records, and not overwrite the base system. The basic process involved here is:

* 


If you find yourself dealing with large tables from the Hydstra system (groundwater or water quality are examples) you may find yourself 


This importer caches data in a provisional, dated SQLite database for further processing
The import also performs some provisional cleansing of the data by removing unclosed quote ("), (') characters that exist in the DNRM GWDB files
